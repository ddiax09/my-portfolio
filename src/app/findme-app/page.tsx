          FindMe is a user-friendly mobile app concept designed to connect
          individuals with local providers of home services, such as
          electricians, doctors, plumbers, and cleaners. The app aims to
          simplify the process of finding and hiring professionals by providing
          a centralized platform where users can browse a diverse range of
          services, read reviews, compare prices, and contact providers
          directly.

            <p className="text-md md:ml-20 text-gray-500 dark:text-neutral-300">
              Finding quality home services has always been a challenge,
              particularly in non-urbanized areas where the variety of options
              is limited. The COVID-19 pandemic has made worse this
              issue by making it harder for local service providers to grow
              their client base. The lack of suitable platforms to advertise
              their services forces them to rely mainly on word-of-mouth
              recommendations, leading many to face significant challenges in
              sustaining their businesses.

              We opted to follow the Design Thinking approach for the design process of this project, following each one of the five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. By following this structure we ensure that our building solution can solve the problems of real users.

              We decided to collect information about the target group by using
              surveys designed to collect and analyze the pain points the people
              have when hiring service providers and the problems the
              professionals have when they try to announce their services. We
              also explored other similar apps in the market to identify their
              focuses, UX/UI, key features and user flows.

              After conducting our research, we identified two types of user
              personas. The first is Felipe, who is looking for a personal
              service but struggles to find the right person to address his
              problem, leading to frustration. The second is Luis, who is trying
              to promote his services to attract more clients. However, his
              efforts on traditional social media have not given him good
              results, and he needs a new platform to advertise his services.

              Once we finished the research process, understood the user personas and created a solid user flow for all the key features of our app, we conducted a process of testing and validating our prototype. In the next picture we show some pictures of the last iteration of the prototype.
